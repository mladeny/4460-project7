Used jquery ui for slider and highcharts for linked pie chart in addition to creating a stacked bar chart with d3js

Make sure files are in the same directory and running behind a web server locally in order to load the csv file and avoid the CORS error message

Clicking on bar chart areas will generate a pie chart with a more detailed view of the percentage distribution of medals.

Tested on Google Chrome browser

Libraries are loaded through online hosted CDN's from d3js, highcharts, and jquery
